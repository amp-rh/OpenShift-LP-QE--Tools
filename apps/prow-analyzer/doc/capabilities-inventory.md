# Prow Analyzer -- Capabilities & Inventory

> Authoritative inventory of everything the Prow Analyzer agent can access or do.
> Derived from the source code, the Slack app manifest
> (`deploy/slack/manifest.yaml`), and the deployment configuration. This document
> backs the "Capabilities and Inventory" section of the
> [User Guide](user-guide.md).

## Data-access classification: **Read-only (with one write)**

Prow Analyzer is **read-only** with respect to every external system **except one
action**: it posts messages to Slack (`chat:write`). It performs **no** writes to
Jira, GitHub, CI/Prow, or any other system. It does not run code, browse the web,
or execute arbitrary tools. Its only analytical capability is delegating a single
prompt to the ship-help MCP; all richer reasoning and data access happen **inside
ship-help**, not in this agent.

| Action class | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Writes (the only side effect)** | Posts an in-thread message to a Slack channel it is a member of. |
| **Reads (direct)** | Slack channel message text (to detect Prow URLs). |
| **Reads (indirect, via ship-help)** | Jira, GitHub, build logs, test results, Firewatch, Slack discussions, internal docs, historical patterns (see below). |
| **Not permitted** | Any write to Jira/GitHub/CI; code execution; web browsing; tools other than the single MCP `ask_persona` call. |

---

## 1. Tools

The agent calls exactly **one external tool**. It has no plug-in tool registry.

| Tool | Provider | Transport | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ask_persona` | ship-help MCP | JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP + SSE | Submits a prompt containing the Prow URL and returns the AI-generated analysis. This is the agent's sole analytical capability. |

---

## 2. Skills

The agent has **no autonomous "skills"** in the LLM/agentic sense (no tool-choosing
loop, no planning, no self-directed multi-step reasoning). It is a deterministic
Go program: detect a Prow URL → send one MCP request → format and post the reply.
All model-driven behavior lives in the ship-help persona, not here.

## 3. APIs

| API | Direction | Auth | Operations used | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ship-help MCP** (`SHIP_HELP_MCP_URL`) | Outbound | `Authorization: Bearer <SHIP_HELP_MCP_TOKEN>` + `Mcp-Session-Id` | `initialize` (protocol `2024-11-05`), `tools/call` → `ask_persona` | JSON-RPC 2.0; response is an SSE stream. Auto-recovers a stale session and retries once. 600s client timeout. |
| **Slack Web API** | Outbound | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (`xoxb-…`) | `chat.postMessage` (via `chat:write`) | Posts analysis, error, and "queue full" replies in-thread. |
| **Slack Socket Mode** | Outbound WebSocket (WSS) | `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (`xapp-…`) | Receives Events API callbacks; `Ack()` | No public ingress; outbound-only. |

**Slack OAuth bot scopes** (from `deploy/slack/manifest.yaml`):

| Scope | Why |
|---|---|
| `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels the bot is a member of (to find Prow URLs). |
| `chat:write` | Post replies. |

**Slack event subscriptions:** `message.channels` only. Interactivity is
disabled; token rotation disabled; org deploy disabled.

> **Discrepancy to note:** `README.md` mentions an `app_mentions:read` scope, but
> the committed manifest grants only `channels:history` and `chat:write`. The
> manifest is authoritative for what the bot actually requests.

## 4. Functions (public code surface)

The exported functions/constants that define the agent's behavior:

**`pkg/analyzer`**

| Symbol | Kind | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `NewAnalyzer(mcpURL, token, promptTemplate)` | func | Constructs the MCP client. |
| `Analyzer.AnalyzeFailure(ctx, jobURL)` | method | Full analysis: session init, `ask_persona`, SSE parse, one retry on stale session. |
| `ExtractProwURL(text)` | func | Extracts the first recognized Prow URL from text. |
| `ContainsProwURL(text)` | func | Boolean check for a Prow URL. |
| `FormatSlackResponse(result)` | func | Formats the reply with header, AI-generated label, footer. |
| `WithDisclaimer(message)` | func | Wraps any message with the disclaimer (top) + review notice (bottom). |
| `Disclaimer`, `ReviewNotice`, `AILabel` | const | Mandatory compliance notices/labels applied to all output. |

**`pkg/slack/handler`**

| Symbol | Kind | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `New(client, analyzer, monitoredChannels)` | func | Builds the event handler; sets channel allowlist / monitor-all. |
| `handler.Handle(callback, logger)` | method | Filter chain + semaphore-gated async dispatch. |
| `handler.Identifier()` | method | Returns `"prow-analyzer"`. |

**Internal-only helpers** (not public API): `ensureSession`, `invalidateSession`,
`doAnalysis`, `initializeSession`, `readSSEData`, `isSessionNotFound`,
`attachSessionInit`, `logTimings`, `analyzeAndRespond`.

## 5. Data Sources (authorized to view)

### Direct (the agent reads these itself)

| Source | Access | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Slack channel messages | `channels:history` | Only public channels the bot has been **invited to**. Reads message text to detect Prow URLs. |
| Prow job URL | From message text / CLI arg | The URL string is passed to ship-help. |
| Runtime configuration | Env vars / CLI flags | `SHIP_HELP_MCP_URL`, `SHIP_HELP_MCP_TOKEN`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `MONITORED_CHANNELS`, `PROMPT_TEMPLATE`/`-prompt`, `TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY`. |

### Indirect (viewed by ship-help on the agent's behalf)

The agent never connects to these directly; it only receives ship-help's
summarized text. Actual access is governed by the ship-help persona and its
service credentials, **not** by the requesting user.

| Data source (via ship-help) | Used for |
|---|---|
| Jira issues (active, historical, related) | Root cause, related issues |
| GitHub repositories and PRs | Code/PR context |
| Build logs and artifacts | Failure detail |
| Test results and history | Failure/flake context |
| Firewatch automated triage | Known-issue correlation |
| Slack team discussions | Prior discussion context |
| Internal documentation | Guidance/runbooks |
| Historical failure patterns | Recurring-pattern analysis |

## 6. Runtime dependencies & network egress

**Libraries** (`go.mod`): `github.com/slack-go/slack v0.14.0`;
`github.com/gorilla/websocket v1.5.0` (indirect); `github.com/stretchr/testify`
(tests). Plus the Go standard library (HTTP, JSON, TLS, regex, concurrency).

**Network egress (outbound only):**
- ship-help MCP endpoint (HTTPS + SSE).
- Slack (WSS for Socket Mode + HTTPS for the Web API).

**No inbound/ingress.** Socket Mode means no public route is exposed.

---

## 7. Authorized vs prohibited actions (summary)

**Autonomous (no human needed):** detect a Prow URL in a monitored channel;
call `ask_persona`; post the analysis/error/queue-full reply in-thread; recover a
stale MCP session and retry once; run up to **5 concurrent** analyses (extras get
a "queue full" reply).

**Requires a human:** any remediation (code, config, Jira, GitHub, retriggering
CI); judging correctness; inviting/removing the bot from channels.

**Prohibited / cannot do:** write to any system other than posting a Slack
message; analyze non-Prow URLs or free-text questions; respond to other bots; act
in channels it hasn't been invited to; browse the web or run arbitrary code.

---

## 8. Access-control note (RBAC)

Access is **not** per-user. The agent uses **shared service credentials** (one
ship-help token, one Slack bot token), so analyses reflect what those service
accounts can see — not the requesting user's permissions. Effective gating is:
**Slack channel membership** (who is in a monitored channel) and **possession of
a valid ship-help token** (for the CLI). See the
[RBAC Enforcement](user-guide.md#rbac-enforcement) section of the User Guide.
